# multi-processing-multi-threading-in-c
An application to perform bubble sort algorithm using multiprocessing and multiprocessing  . This is possible since bubble exchanges only when it meets a less value. A subset can be sorted using bubblesort and sorted subsets sorted again by the same algorithm.There won't be exchage for the same member for a subset. The application is run when the data divided into 2, 4 and 10 groups in which are sorted in different processes and threads. Data to be sorted is always read by the parent process or the first thread.
