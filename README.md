# multi-processing-multi-threading-in-c
An application to perform multiprocessing and multiprocessing on bubble sort algorithm. This is possible since bubble exchanges only when it meets a less value. A subset can be sorted using bubblesort and sorted subsets sorted again by the same algorithm.There won't be exchage for the same member for a subset. The application is run when the data divided into 2, 4 and 10 groups in which are run in different process and then on different threads.
